## TDD

> Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle: first the developer writes an (initially failing) automated test case that defines a desired improvement or new function, then produces the minimum amount of code to pass that test, and finally refactors the new code to acceptable standards.

## FizzBuzz

Originally a children's game created to practise multiplication and division, FizzBuzz is solved by running through integers from 1 to 100. For multiples of three (3), ‘Fizz’ is displayed, for multiples of five (5), ‘Buzz’ is displayed and for multiples of both three (3) and five (5), ‘FizzBuzz’ is displayed. Anything that is not a multiple of either three (3) or five (5) is displayed as the integer.
